# Wifite2 Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the integration of wifite2 into Bjorn's attack actions system. The integration allows Bjorn to automatically scan for wireless networks, attempt to crack them, and connect to any successfully compromised networks.

## What Was Added

### 1. Wifite2Connector Action (`actions/wifite2_connector.py`)
A new action class that integrates wifite2 into Bjorn's attack system:

**Key Features:**
- **Network Scanning**: Uses wifite2 to scan for available wireless networks
- **Attack Methods**: Supports multiple attack vectors:
  - WPS Pixie-Dust attacks
  - WPA handshake capture and cracking
  - PMKID attacks
- **Network Connection**: Automatically connects to successfully cracked networks
- **Results Storage**: Saves cracked networks and available networks to JSON files
- **Statistics Tracking**: Updates Bjorn's wireless statistics

**Main Methods:**
- `scan_for_networks()`: Scans for available wireless networks
- `attack_network(network)`: Attacks a specific network using wifite2
- `connect_to_network(network)`: Connects to a successfully cracked network
- `execute_wireless_attack()`: Orchestrates the complete wireless attack process
- `get_statistics()`: Returns wireless attack statistics

### 2. Enhanced Network Scanning (`actions/scanning.py`)
Updated the existing network scanner to include wireless scanning:

**New Features:**
- **Automatic Wireless Detection**: Checks if wireless scanning should be performed
- **Smart Triggering**: Performs wireless scans when:
  - No alive hosts are found on the network
  - No wireless-related activity is detected (ports 80, 443, 8080, 8443)
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing network scanning workflow

**New Methods:**
- `check_and_perform_wireless_scan()`: Determines if wireless scanning is needed
- `perform_wireless_scan()`: Executes wireless network scanning and attacks

### 3. Configuration Settings (`shared.py` and `config/shared_config.json`)
Added comprehensive wireless configuration options:

**New Configuration Options:**
- `wireless_scan_enabled`: Enable/disable wireless scanning (default: True)
- `wireless_attack_timeout`: Timeout for wireless attacks in seconds (default: 300)
- `wireless_scan_interval`: Interval between wireless scans in seconds (default: 600)
- `wireless_retry_failed`: Retry failed wireless attacks (default: True)
- `wireless_wps_priority`: Prioritize WPS-enabled networks (default: True)
- `wireless_pmkid_enabled`: Enable PMKID attacks (default: True)
- `wireless_handshake_enabled`: Enable WPA handshake attacks (default: True)

### 4. Statistics Integration (`shared.py`)
Added wireless statistics tracking to Bjorn's scoring system:

**New Statistics:**
- `wirelessnbr`: Count of successfully cracked wireless networks
- **Coin Calculation**: Wireless networks contribute 8 coins each
- **Level Calculation**: Wireless networks contribute 0.3 levels each

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Triggering
When Bjorn performs network scanning:
1. **Network Scan**: Scans for live hosts and open ports
2. **Activity Check**: Checks if any alive hosts have wireless-related ports
3. **Wireless Decision**: If no activity detected, triggers wireless scanning
4. **Configuration Check**: Verifies wireless scanning is enabled

### 2. Wireless Attack Process
When wireless scanning is triggered:
1. **Network Discovery**: Uses wifite2 to scan for available networks
2. **Priority Selection**: Prioritizes WPS-enabled networks if configured
3. **Attack Execution**: Attempts to crack networks using configured methods
4. **Connection Attempt**: Tries to connect to successfully cracked networks
5. **Results Storage**: Saves results and updates statistics

### 3. Integration with Bjorn's Workflow
The wifite2 integration follows Bjorn's existing patterns:
- **Action Structure**: Follows the same pattern as other actions (SSH, SMB, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Uses the shared configuration system
- **Statistics**: Integrates with Bjorn's scoring and leveling system
- **Logging**: Uses Bjorn's logging system for consistent output

## Configuration

### Enabling/Disabling Wireless Scanning
```json
{
  "wireless_scan_enabled": true
}
```

### Adjusting Attack Timeouts
```json
{
  "wireless_attack_timeout": 300
}
```

### Configuring Attack Methods
```json
{
  "wireless_wps_priority": true,
  "wireless_pmkid_enabled": true,
  "wireless_handshake_enabled": true
}
```

## File Structure

```
actions/
├── wifite2_connector.py          # New wireless attack action
└── scanning.py                   # Updated with wireless integration

config/
└── shared_config.json            # Updated with wireless settings

data/output/
└── wireless_results/             # New directory for wireless results
    ├── cracked_networks.json     # Successfully cracked networks
    └── available_networks.json   # Discovered networks
```

## Dependencies

The wifite2 integration requires:
- **wifite2**: Wireless attack tool (installed via install_bjorn.sh)
- **aircrack-ng**: Wireless security suite
- **reaver/bully**: WPS attack tools
- **hashcat**: Password cracking
- **hcxdumptool/hcxpcapngtool**: PMKID tools
- **nmcli**: Network connection management

## Security Considerations

1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure wireless attacks are performed only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **Configuration**: Use configuration options to control attack methods and timeouts
3. **Logging**: All wireless activities are logged for audit purposes
4. **Results Storage**: Cracked network credentials are stored securely

## Usage Examples

### Manual Execution
```python
from actions.wifite2_connector import Wifite2Connector
from shared import SharedData

shared_data = SharedData()
wifite2_connector = Wifite2Connector(shared_data)
success = wifite2_connector.execute_wireless_attack()
```

### Automatic Execution
The wireless scanning is automatically triggered when:
- No network hosts are alive
- No wireless-related activity is detected
- Wireless scanning is enabled in configuration

## Testing

The integration includes comprehensive testing:
- Configuration validation
- File structure verification
- Integration checks
- Statistics tracking validation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Advanced Attack Methods**: Support for additional wireless attack vectors
2. **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of connected networks
3. **Automated Exploitation**: Automatic exploitation of connected networks
4. **Reporting**: Enhanced reporting and visualization of wireless results
5. **Mobile Integration**: Support for mobile wireless networks

## Conclusion

The wifite2 integration successfully adds wireless network attack capabilities to Bjorn while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase architecture. The integration is configurable, secure, and follows Bjorn's established patterns for actions, configuration, and statistics tracking.
